Hello! I am Romit. I love building data-driven tools and products. I have `(Current year - 2018)` years of work experience in arranging matrices.

## A bit about my experience

- ML engineer at [Sarvam.ai](https://www.sarvam.ai/), [February 2025-Present]
    - Currently working on pre-training vision encoders for sovereign vision language models.
    - Led post-training quantization and inference optimization of [Sarvam-M, a 24B LLM](https://www.sarvam.ai/blogs/sarvam-m).
    - Built a highly fault-tolerant, scalable central store for pre-training datasets using WebDatasets.
    - Worked with TensorRT LLM, vLLM, WebDatasets, and K8s.

- AI engineer at [Meraki Labs](https://www.merakilabs.com/), [December 2023-January 2025]
    - Pre-trained [small audio language models](https://huggingface.co/11mlabs/indri-0.1-124m-tts). This model aligned audio and text tokens into the same space, enabling TTS, ASR, and text-to-voice continuation from a single model.
    - Spent time understanding the [audio domain](https://pypi.org/project/audiotoken/) and [how its modeling works](https://www.indrivoice.ai/blog/2024-11-19-audio-modelling).
    - Developed [custom GPU kernels](https://github.com/indri-voice/vit.triton) in Triton to accelerate inferencing and [researched inference bottlenecks in the audio domain](https://github.com/romitjain/gpt-benchmark).
    - Worked with Triton, CUDA C, and PyTorch.

- Senior Data Scientist at [epifi](https://fi.money/), [November 2020-October 2023]
    - Built customer-support call categorization pipelines using Whisper, Mistral 7B, and fine-tuned BERT.
    - Trained and deployed real-time and batch fraud-detection models using computer vision and tree-based methods.
    - Built infrastructure for real-time and batched feature engineering and optimized model deployment.
    - Worked with Tensorflow, Docker, PySpark, Airflow, EFK stack, and the usual AWS stack.

- Technical Lead at [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [January 2018-November 2020]
    - Founding member of the data team; built an [analytics platform](https://medium.com/better-practices/api-driven-analytics-d980b28cb15e) supporting over 1,000 production dashboards.
    - Architected data testing frameworks and data warehouse table design to power business analytics.
    - Worked with SQL, Redshift, Looker, DBT, and PowerBI.

- I was on the team that built the project [Panoptic](https://panoptic.in).

## Places where I have talked about my work experience

- Gave a talk on efficient inferencing at [AI Inference Meetup with NVIDIA](https://www.meetup.com/futureofdata-bangalore/events/306677681/).
- Gave a demo on audio language models at [AI Tinkerers Bengaluru](https://bengaluru.aitinkerers.org/talks/rsvp_2eKJ-4Lkk5E) chapter.
- Gave a workshop at [Fifth Elephant conference](http://has.gy/dQUb) on writing efficient Triton GPU Kernels.
- Speaker at [2022 AWS ML Fridays series](https://pages.awscloud.com/ml-fridays-reg-2022.html) for fraud detection using Amazon SageMaker.

## A bit about what I love doing

- Tech I love working with - Python, Triton, PyTorch, SQL, Docker, FastAPI.
- Areas I am interested in:
    - Systems around LLMs
    - Applied deep learning, especially computer vision
    - Human in-loop decisions
- Reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100308617-romit), playing cricket, and petting cats.
- Obsessed with calendars, to-dos, tracking every little thing, and shiny productivity apps.
