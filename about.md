Hello! I am Romit. I love building data-driven tools and products. I have `(Current year - 2018)` years of work experience in making companies data-driven and building production-level ML/DL models.

## A bit about my experience

- [December 2023-Present]
  - I am currently working at Meraki Labs as an AI engineer where I am working on synthetic data generation, RAGs, small-scale multimodal agents, and GPU optimizations
  - I primarily work with Triton, CUDA C, and PyTorch

- [November 2020-October 2023]
  - I worked at [epiFi](https://www.fi.money) as a Senior data scientist where I built real-time computer vision and machine learning models
  - This involved building infrastructure for real-time and batch models, like a ton of real-time feature engineering (>1k features), optimizations for deploying deep learning and ML models with lower latency (TF lite, quantization, in memory DBs), and building highly observable micro-services
  - I worked extensively with Tensorflow, Docker, PySpark, Airflow, EFK stack, and the usual AWS stack

- [January 2018-November 2020]
  - I worked at [Postman](https://www.postman.com) as a Technical lead in the data science team and was the founding member of the data team
  - I built and designed several internal tools including
    - [Data APIs](https://medium.com/better-practices/api-driven-analytics-d980b28cb15e): This was my major work at Postman that helped Postman to be data-aware and data-driven
    - Data testing framework (Based on Looker and DBT)
    - [Knowledge Repository](https://blog.postman.com/how-postman-built-a-knowledge-repository/)
    - ETL pipelines
  - I worked on SQL, Redshift, Looker, DBT and PowerBI

- I was on the team that built the project [Panoptic](https://panoptic.in).

## A bit about what I love doing

- Tech I love working with - Python, CUDA C, PyTorch, SQL, Docker, FastAPI
- Areas I am interested in
  - Applied deep learning, especially computer vision
  - Human in-loop decisions
  - MLOps
- Reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100308617-romit), playing cricket, and petting cats
- Obsessed with calendars, to-dos, tracking every litte thing, and shiny productivity apps
