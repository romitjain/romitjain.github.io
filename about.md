Hello! I am Romit. I love building data driven tools and products. I have ~4 years of work experience in making companies data-driven and building production level ML/DL models.

## A bit about my experience

- [November 2020-Present]
  - I am currently working at [epiFi](https://www.fi.money) where I am working on a cool Computer vision model that serves ~10K users per day.
    - Built a dashboard tracking live confusion matrix and other model performance metrics
  - I built the model serving Popular FAQs in the app.
  - Also built a better logging module for data scientists, and framework for segmentation and growth analysis of users.

- [January 2018-November 2020]
  - I worked at [Postman](https://www.postman.com) as a Technical lead in the data science team.
  - I started my career at Postman as a data science intern and during my internship I worked on network analysis of 2M users on a graph database.
  - I built and designed several internal tools including
    - [Data APIs](https://medium.com/better-practices/api-driven-analytics-d980b28cb15e): This was my major work at Postman that helped organization to be more data aware and data driven
    - Data testing framework (Based on Looker, DBT)
    - [Knowledge repository](https://blog.postman.com/how-postman-built-a-knowledge-repository/)
    - ETL pipelines
  - I also built a warehouse connector library for feature engineering but that didn't scale really well.

- I was on the team that built project [Panoptic](https://panoptic.in).

## A bit about what I love doing

- Tech I love working with: Python, SQL, Tensorlfow, Docker, FastAPI, neo4j, DBT
- Areas I am interested in
  - Applied machine learning and deep learning
    - Computer Vision, Network Science
  - Human in loop decisions
  - MLOps
- Reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100308617-romit), playing cricket and petting cats
- Obsessed with calendars, to-dos, tracking every litte thing, and shiny productivity apps
