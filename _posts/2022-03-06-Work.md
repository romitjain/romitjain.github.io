## How I work/Purpose

This is my interpretation of how I like to work, feedback is welcome! Especially if my view of how I think I like to work doesn't match your experience of how it seems I like to work!

## When I work

I like to work fairly early in the morning (not super early). I typically start my working day at 9:30 AM and end it around 6 PM. I like to have two focus slots

1. In the early morning (10 AM - 12 AM): Mostly for admin, urgent and important, low hanging tasks
2. During the afternoon (2 PM - 5 PM): For working on a single big task that requires a lot of attention and focus

I like to have meetings in between these slots. Sometimes I work late in the night (third focus slot: 8 PM - 10 PM), but I really don't prefer having calls after 5 PM.

Thursdays and Fridays are my meeting days. I try to have most of the meetings on these two days.

## Where I work

Ideally, I would want to work 3-4 days from home and 1-2 days from the office. I have realized that when I want to work with a high focus on a single big task, I tend to be better at them when I work from home.

For meetings, it's best for me to meet in person and avoid awkward silences on meets and zoom calls.

## What I do

Broadly

1. Build predictive models
2. Data analysis
3. Write pipelines to automate the above stuff

## Communication

I am a huge fan of [asynchronous communication](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#what-is-asynchronous-work). A few of the rules that I try to follow while communicating at work

1. I never expect immediate replies on Slack until and unless it's urgent and critical. Replying within the day is fine.
2. I would give prior notice before calling. Until and unless it's critical.
3. I schedule meetings after giving prior notice and will almost always try to include an agenda.
4. I think a lot before scheduling a meeting. For me, meetings should be focused on discussing and assigning action items, discussing blockers but not iterating on task and status updates.
5. I am not a fan of updates meetings. Updates can be shared offline on Slack. That's why I don't like Standups.

## Things I struggle with

1. On-the-spot thinking and solutions. I have found that whenever I do this, my solutions are sub-optimal. I would rather take some time to think about the solution properly.
2. Asking for help.

## Things I love

1. Feedback. If you have any, please share directly.
2. Documentation. Always up for documenting the products/tools I built or used
3. Self-serve platforms
4. Mails > Slacks > Meetings are my preferred order of communication.
5. Minimal dashboards with 2-3 important metrics
6. Organizing anything really.
