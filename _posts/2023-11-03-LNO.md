Divide your tasks into 3 categories

1. Leverage (L): These are tasks which give you 10x return on your time investment in terms of impact. These are usually complex tasks and require focus and time.
2. Neutral (N): These are the tasks which give you 1x return on your time investment
3. Obligatory (O): These tasks do not give you good return on your time investment

Try to maximize the time you spend on L tasks. Try to automate or delegate N tasks.

L tasks are the most important one and generates the most value. So you need the maximum attention for these kinds of tasks. You need to schedule them around the time when you have the most energy levels.

If you are not able to get around working on L tasks, you can spend some clearing N/O tasks to reach in a pseudo productivity flow and then start working on the L tasks after that.
