## Context

Writing is probably one of the best ways for me to cope with anxiety and stress. I sometimes write *a lot* (in a relative sense). I once wrote a complete guide for myself on how to relocate to a different city.

There are different types of writing I do.

1. Writing for learning
2. Writing for planning
3. Journaling

The system for the first two is covered in [How I take notes](/notes). This post is about the third type of writing I do.

## Why do I journal?

I have personally felt the benefits of writing down my thoughts whether they are pleasant or unpleasant. Sometimes when I write my unpleasant thoughts, it either gives me clarity on how to tackle the problem or makes me realize that the problem is not as bad I was thinking. Writing pleasant things makes for a good smile and memory when I read them later.

If I am constantly feeling languished, irritated, just overjoyed, I usually collect my thoughts and write them down.

## How do I journal?

Really simple. I have a straightforward template that I follow.

```markdown
## Gratitude
<!-- What am I grateful for? -->
I don't force myself to write this section.

## Journal
<!-- What's going on in my mind? -->

## What am I looking forward to?
<!-- Anything interesting to look forward to? -->
```

I journal once on weekends and once mid week, but I am hoping to increase my frequency.
