- Subject line is the top of the funnel
    - Always optimize the subject line
    - Subject line needs to be catchy, should pique interest and stand out
- Keep the language extremely simple in the subject
    - Short greetings, no need for appraisals
    - Write the objective of writing mail
    - End with what the ask is (very clearly)
    - Mention if there is no ask
- Research
    - Do the homework before writing a cold email
    - Apply in their context for them to reply
