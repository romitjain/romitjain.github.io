## Welcome to my second brain

```python
print('Hello World!')
```

Printing Hello World seems a fitting introductory page to a `(almost)` dev's website.

Hi, I am Romit. I have created this website to share some of my ideas/ramblings. These are sometimes unfinished and evolve continuously. I write everything on this website for myself.

I have two major goals with this website

1. Crystallize my thought process. Writing helps in this.
2. Share my learning and failures. A way for me to give back to the internet (from where I have learned almost everything!).

You can learn more about me [here](/about). You can also browse the website by [dates](/archive) or [category](/category)

## Inspiration for this website
