## Welcome to my second brain

```python
print('Hello World!')
```

Printing Hello World seems a fitting introductory page to a dev's website.

Hi, I am Romit. I have created this website to share some of my ideas/ramblings. These are sometimes unfinished and evolve continuously. I write everything on this website for myself.

I have two major goals with this website.

1. Avoid myself from fooling myself that I understand a topic
2. Write a note to me reminding me of important things

You can learn more about me [here](/about).
