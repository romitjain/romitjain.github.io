Slack (or the likes of it) is a ubiquitous tool nowdays given how remote work has become popular (specially in tech companies). Here are some guidelines I follow when I manage my Slack

## Why to manage Slack?

Even if you are working from office, it's important to manage your slack. It can help you to be better at responding to people (improves transperancy) and avoid missing on critical messages.

It also allows you to have minimal disruption in your day.

Slack is not an instant messaging app (IMO). Until and unless an issue is critical, all slack messages should be treated as asyncronous messages that you can reply within T+6 hours.
