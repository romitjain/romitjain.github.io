## Context

When I was in 11th standard, I deleted my facebook account (this was in 2012, when Facebook was *very* popular). I then proceeded to delete my instagram and whatsapp account as well. This was a time when people didn't even have instagram and whatsapp accounts in my circle.

I have had a lot of conversations with people over the years on why I have been so *anti-social*?

## Anti-social

Even though I deleted my social media accounts due to a different reason, I have come to love a life without too much interaction with social media. I have realized a few things that make me not like social media too much

1. Social media app's interest and your personal interest probably do not match. Almost all social media website wants you to spend as much time possible on their website. Due to this, they will do everything possible to grasp your attention. They'll also try to get as much data on you as possible to show you relevant content. I am not against this practice if it's used building meaningful products, but using my data to bait me into spending more time on your app? Hell no!
2. Also, uploading a picture and getting likes on them gives you a dopamine hit. Too much of it can bait you into opening the app again and again. That can really mess up your attention span and focus.
3. When we communicate with other people face to face, then apart from listening to them, we also depend on visual cues to understand what the other person is commmunicating. Social media (+ Instant messaging) apps kill these forms of cues. This is why there are a lot of misunderstandings when you communicate on social media apps. And this why zoom meetings will never be same as in person meetings. In every virtual meeting I have attended, someone or the other has spoken in between or over others precisely because there was no visual cue as to when they should speak.

There are a lot of benefits of social media as well, but I really feel that most of the people don't use it properly. They are controlled by dopamine hits of social media apps rather then they controlling their usage on the app.

## Disclosure

I have created my WhatsApp and Instagram account again due to some reasons. But I still don't use it very often. I don't have Instagram app on my phone and my whatsapp notifications are turned off.
