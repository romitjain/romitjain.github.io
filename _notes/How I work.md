## How I work/Purpose

This is my interpretation of how I like to work, feedback is welcome! Especially if my view of how I think I like to work doesn't match your experience of how it seems I like to work!

## When I work

I like to work fairly early in the morning (not super early). I typically start my working day at 9:30 AM and end it around 6 PM. I like to have two focus slots

1. In the early morning (10 AM - 12 AM): Mostly for admin, urgent and important, low hanging tasks
2. During the afternoon (2 PM - 5 PM): For working on a single big task that requires a lot of attention and focus

I like to have meetings in between these slots. Sometimes I work late in the night (third focus slot: 8 PM - 10 PM), but I really don't prefer having calls after 5 PM.

Thursdays and Fridays are my meeting days. I try to have most of the meetings on these two days.

## Where I work

Ideally, I would want to work 3-4 days from home and 1-2 days from the office. I have realized that when I want to work with a high focus on a single big task, I tend to be better at them when I work from home.

For meetings, it's best for me to meet in person and avoid awkward silences on meets and zoom calls.

## What I do

Broadly

1. Build predictive models
    1.1 Based on machine learning or deep learning or simple rules
2. Data analysis
    2.1 For growth analysis, model analysis or feature analysis
3. Write pipelines to automate the above stuff

## Communication

I am a huge fan of [asynchronous communication](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#what-is-asynchronous-work).

[[I really appreciate the same behavior from my colleagues as well, but I do recognize that everyone is different.::rmn]]

Few of the rules I follow while communicating at work

1. I never expect immediate replies on Slack until and unless it's urgent and critical. Replying within the day is fine.
2. I would give prior notice before calling. Until and unless it's critical.
3. I schedule meetings after giving prior notice and will almost always try to include an agenda.
4. I think a lot before scheduling a meeting. For me, meetings should be focused on discussing and assigning action items, discussing blockers but not iterating on task and status updates.
5. I am not a fan of updates meetings. Updates can be shared offline on Slack. That's why I don't like Standups.

## Things I struggle with

1. On-the-spot thinking and solutions. I have found that whenever I do this, my solutions are sub-optimal. I would rather take some time to think about the solution properly.
2. Asking for help

## Things I love

[[Work related::rmn]]

1. Feedback. If you have any, please share directly.
2. Documentation. Always up for documenting for the products/tools I built or used
3. Self serve platforms
4. Mails/Slacks > Meetings are my preferred order of communication.
5. Minimal dashboards with 2-3 important metrics
6. Organizing anything really.

## Other things to know about me

As I mentioned earlier, I really love any feedback. Feedback has helped me grow as a person, and if you have any feedback, please feel free to share it.

In the meetings, I like to take notes and absorb as much information as possible. If I am silent this does not mean that I don't like the presented ideas or I don't have any views. I might come back later with a few more points when I had some time to think about it.

I love pets, especially cats. If you ever want to talk about them HMU.
