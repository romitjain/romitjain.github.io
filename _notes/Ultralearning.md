- Ultra learning requires learning with high intensity and commitmment.
- Source of happiness is not achieving simple things, but constantly pushing ourselves and overcoming our own limitations.
- Ultra learning needs a practical reason to learn something (where would you apply your learning?) + an inspiration that excites us (we'll feel smarter after learning this)

## Principles for learning more effectively and efficiently (ultra learning project)

### Meta learning
1. Chart out a rough plan for what we want to learn. Research early by figuring out source material, where we'd learn things from, what is the timeline we are looking for etc.
2. Figure out why, what, how of ultra learning project
3. Don't spend too much time. Stop researching (or meta learning when the incremental benefits are marginal)

### Focus
1. The ability to focus is under rated. Develop it and if it helps stop using things that ruin your focus ([[Social media bad]])
2. Complex tasks require deep focus, low arousal (so that we don't wander off easily) and relaxed atmosphere
3. Listening to music while working might be increasing our arousal levels.

### Directness
1. Apply our learning directly to a practical situation
2. Learning with directness is tough, requires [[Active effort]]. That is why we might descend to passive learning (eg: just watching lectures instead of applying that knowledge, reading book instead of solving problems)
3. Supports the idea of just in time learning
4. Organize our learning around producing something

### Drill
1. Drill down on most important parts of an ultra learning project (eg: learning about the internal workings of CNNs completely in Computer Vision domain)
