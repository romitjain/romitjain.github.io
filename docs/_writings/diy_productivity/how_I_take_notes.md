## Intro

After reading a lot on the topic of taking notes and practicing note taking for almost 8 years, I realize that having a good system of accumulating notes on relevant topics is far more important than noting things down for storing purposes.

There are multiple ways to take notes. The tools we use are irrelevant. What we need is a system of taking useful and long lasting notes and making sure that we don't let incomplete, useless and transient notes pile up. I do believe that taking notes digitally is more scalable and secure.

(PS: I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to take all my notes.)

Here I'll explain a system I use to take notes. They are not yet proven to be effective, but hopefully, I can learn and make them better.

## Types of notes

### Daily log

1. These are my daily notes titled in the format `yyyy-mm-dd` (yay, automatic sorting) which I typically write at the start of the day.
2. These are templatized to get me started quickly. They should be the most low friction notes
3. Here, I write a rough outline of my day, of what all I want to do and some thoughts around them
4. Everything from meeting notes to ideas around tasks go here
5. The most important thing in this document is: **Daily Highlight**, where I write down the single most important thing that I want to do that day
6. Once we get better at it, we can create daily log of future dates where we plan our action items in advance. We can jot down some ideas that we want to think about in the future to de-clutter our brain
7. I also note down whatever useful I consume from unstructured resources (Youtube videos, adhoc article etc.)
8. At the end of the week, we can review all the daily notes of the week and extract out anything useful and move them to **Topic notes**. I am able to this 80-85% of the time.
9. **Note**: This is not a To-Do list. It is much more than that

### Topic notes

1. These are the notes of useful topics that I would like to remember
2. Typically scraped from my **Daily log**, but they can also directly come from other sources
3. These includes: Thoughts, prompts, quotes, sources, etc.
4. 1 inbox note contains stuff around a single topic (eg: Stoicism, Web 3 or Docker)
5. Ideally, they should be transient notes, similar to when we are researching for a topic and we read up a lot of stuff and collect resources on them
6. These notes contain thoughts that are not our's, but rather someone else's, which is fine for some topics, but if we want to get better and dig deeper on some topics, we move on to Evergreen notes

### Evergreen notes

1. This is where the fun begins. I can't explain it better than Andy Matuschak, so I'll link his work [here](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).
    1. TLDR: These notes are atomic (about a single topic or idea) and accumulate over time and projects. They are also our thoughts and learning on the topic
2. One thing I'd say though is that, we don't need to write evergreen notes for each and every topic we encounter.
3. We'd be fine if we have Topic notes on medium-important topics.
4. I don't have a lot of evergreen notes, but I have started creating them more often

### Project notes

1. These are notes around a single project
2. They can contain a list of all relevant Evergreen notes or Topic notes
3. They can serve as an index, and or be linked to the Daily log

### Literature notes

1. I am new to these kinds of notes, but they are usually notes that serve as a connecting node between different notes
2. These can be author names like `Daniel Kahneman` or tool names like `Obsidian`

I still haven't figured out a systematic way of physically organizing my notes (folder structure etc.). I'll write about it as and when I create one.
