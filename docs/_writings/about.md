Hello! I am Romit. I love building data driven tools and products. I have ~4 years of work experience in making companies data-driven and building production level ML/DL models.

A bit about me:
- [November 2020-Present]
    - I am currently working at [epiFi](fi.money) where I am working on a cool Computer vision problem that serves ~10K users per day
- [January 2018-November 2020]
    - I worked at [Postman](postman.com) as a Technical lead in the data science team
    - I started my career at Postman as a data science intern and during my internship I worked on network analysis on a graph database
    - I built and designed several internal tools including data APIs, data testing framework, ETL pipelines and knowledge repository
    - I also built warehouse connecter for feature engineering but that didn't scale really well
- I have worked as a volunteer engineer with [Omdena](https://omdena.com/) and [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/) on several projects for societal good
